# Mapping_Earthquakes

## An Overview of My Content

Thanks for taking a look at my mapping work! When exploring my Earthquake_Challenge file, you will load an html web page that takes a look at the positions of Tectonic Plates, as well as Earthquakes that have taken place over the past 7 days.

The purpose of superimposing this data onto a map, is it allows us to analyze the correlation of plate crossovers with frequency - and severity - of Earthquakes. 

On the webpage, you will find three map options for your personal use, as well as toggles to remove and add data from your view as you please.

Thanks!
